Do not use website for only git repository.

## Why use Beryllium?

### Natively

Compiled with rust, program will be fast.

### Memory-safe

Using rust, memory error is (probably) not reported in runtime.

### Not web scraping!

Web scraping will be banned your ip in github or else.
Use API for data.

### Customizing the app.

Don't use CSS, natively change app and not impact performance.
You can make own theme or change app for lower API uses or cache plugin.
All plugin will be compiled with webassembly and will be used in webassembly sandbox.
